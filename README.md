I'm Julien form France, and i create websites with JavaScript. I realy enjoy working with JavaScript and its environment and i want to go further with it. I'm currently more confortable with the backend side of a website but i have started to learn React from few weeks and i have to say that i really enjoy working with it. I have also some skills in the database area. I've learned during my studies the PotgreSQL language and a little bit of MongoDB. I realy like to be a part of a project and watch him grow and evolved. I'm looking for a company to work with during my next year of studies.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS/ Node.js / PostgeSQL / REACT / Clojure
